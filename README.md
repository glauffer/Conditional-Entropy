# Conditional-Entropy
Find periods using the conditional entropy method

The algorithm computes the Shannon Conditional Entropy to find periods of variable stars based on the work of [Graham et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.434.2629G)

This method is part of the [Plotypus](https://github.com/astroswego/plotypus) library, a tool to manage time series of variable stars.
